First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! All types of contributions are encouraged and valued and the community looks forward to your contributions. ðŸŽ‰

And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:
- Star the project
- Post about it on Bluesky
- Mention the project to your state representatives
